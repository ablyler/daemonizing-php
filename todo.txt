Things we're going to do:
Andy -- add meat to thumb nailer section
Make the terminal videos larger
In the end column ( other options and why we chose this approach )
Slide animation of the overall flow - parent, children, buckets


Things we might do:
How could you use our forking library
Why did we build this in the first place ( Early History )
Maybe word cloud for options you can set
Use cacti graphs to show things like buckets helping.
